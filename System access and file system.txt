Root :-

There are 3 type of root on Linux -
1. Root account: most powerful account which has access to all command and files.
2.Root as /: the very first directory in Linux is also called root directory.
3. Root as home directory: the root user account also has a directory located in / root which is called root home directory.

Changing Password :-

Command = passwd userid

File System :-

It is system used by OS to manage files. The system controls how data is saved or retrieved.
Eg of Linux File System :- ext3,ext4 ,xfs

File system structure and its description :-

1. /boot :-Contains files that is used by the boot loader(grub.cfg)
2./root :- root user home directory. It is not same as /
3./dev :- System devices
4./etc : Configuration files 
5./bin :- Everyday user commands
6./sbin :- System/filesystem commands
7./proc :- Running process.
8./lib:- C programming library files needed by command and apps.
9. /tmp :- Directory for temporary files
10 ./home :- Directory for user.
11 ./var :- System logs 
12. .run :-System daemons that start very early to store temporary runtime files like PID files.
13./mnt :-To mount external filesystem.
14./media :- For cdrom mounts


Navigating File System :-

cd: change directory
pwd :print working directory.
ls :list 
(cd ..) :- u go one step back by doing this 

Properties of Linux file or directory :- 

do ls -l 
directory start with d ,link with l and files with - .
using this command we will also get the info about directory like how and when it was created.

Paths of file system.

1. Absolute path :- 
   Always begin with "/" .This indicated that the path starts at the root directory. An example of an absolute path is :- cd/var/log/samba.

2.Relative path :- does not begin with "/". It defines a location relative to your current position. An example is :- 
cd var 
cd log 
cd samba

Creating files and Directories 

Creating files 
touch  || cp || vi 
Creating Directory 
mkdir

touch command can create multiple file in single go .
eg : touch a b c 

Copying Directories :- 
 use " cp " command 
 
eg :cp -R <source folder><destination folder>


#Finding Files and directories :- 
 
Command 
 1. Find 
 2. Locate

find <location where u have to search > "word to be searched "

Locate "word to be searched "

#Difference between locate and find.

Locate command uses a prebuilt database which should be regularly updated, while find iterates over a filesystem to locate files. Thus, locate is much faster than find but can be inaccurate if the database is not updated .
To update the DB run Updatedb.

#Wildcards:-

A Character that can be used as a substitute for any of a class of character in a search.

 * : represents zero or more character.
? : represents single character 
[] :represents a range of character.


#Linux File Types:- 
 
file symbol 	regular meaning 
 - 		Regular file 
 d		Directory
 l  		Link
 c		Special file or device file 
 s		socket 
 p 		Named pipe 
 b 		Block device 

# Soft links and Hard Links 

inode= pointer or number of a file on the hard disk
Soft link =Link will be removed if file is removed or renamed 
Hard Link = Deleting renaming or moving the original file will not affect the hard link.

You cannot create soft link or hard link within the same directory with the same name. That is why we will create links in /tmp directory.

Softlink command : 
	ln -s 
verify using ls -ltr
ls -li:to find the inode 


HardLink command : 
  	ln
