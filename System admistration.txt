		#Linux File Editor 

A text editor is a program which enables you to create and manipulate data in a Linux file.

vi supplies commands for :-
	1)inserting and deleting text 
	2)Replacing text
	3)Moving around the file
	4)Finding and substituting strings 
	5)Cutting and pasting keys 

Most common keys :

	i = insert
	esc=escape out of any mode 
	d=delete
	r=replace
	q!= quit without saving 
	wq!=quit and save

 #Difference between vi and vim editor

Vim is based in the vi ,it has all the features as vi  + some excellent addition. There is also a comprehensive help system and lots of customisation options available.

#SED Command :-

Replace a string in a file with a newstring
used to find and delete a line in a large file 
remove empty line 
remove the first or n lines in a file 
to replace tabs with spaces 
show defined lines from a file 
substitute within vi editor 

eg :
 sed 's/Kenny/lenny/g' <file_name> = Kenny changes to lenny 
s=substitute and g = for all the Kenny 

		#User Account Management 

Command :-
	useradd
	groupadd
	userdel
	groupdel
	usermod

eg :
useradd spider -create user spider 
id spider - it will check if user "spider" os created or not 
groupadd superhero - add a group named superhero
userdel -r spider  - it will delete the user spider 

groupadd newgrp
groupdel newgrp

usermod : modifies the user account 

		#Switch Users and sudo Access

Commands :-
	su - username : change to another user 
	sudo command : 
	visudo


		#Monitor Users 
who : how many people are logged in along with their terminal ID
LAST : All every user details since day 1 of all users who logged 	in.

	#Talking to users - 
users 
wall : broadcast ur msg to everyone who is logged in to Linux system.(Ctrl +d for saving).
write : it transform from one user to another user.
 eg : write <username>

	#Special permissions 

All permission on a file or  directory are referred to as bits.

There are 3 additional permissions :-
	setuid : bit tells Linux to run a program with the 			effective user id of the owner instead of the 			executor.
		eg : passwd
	setgid :bit tell Linux to run a program with the effective 		group id of the owner instead of the executor.
		eg :locate or wall

	sticky bit :- a bit set on files/directories that allows 		only the owner or root to delete those files.
	
To assign special permission at the user level : chmod u+s xyz.sh
To assign special permission at the group level : chmod g+s xyz.sh
To remove special permission at the user or group level 
	chmod u-s xyz.sh
	chmod g-s xyz.sh

To find all executables in Linux with setuid and setgid permissions : 
	find / -perm /6000 -type f 

Note : These bits work on C programming executables not on bash shell script 

			# Linux Account Authentication 
Types of Accounts :
Local Accounts 
Domain /Directory Account 

			#Notes :-

Difference between Active Directory ,LDAP, IDM , WinBIND ,OpenLDAP etc 

Active Directory is used in windows environment 
IDM :Identity Manager ,built by Redhat .
WinBIND : Used in Linux to Communicate with windows
OpenLDAP(Open source) :- specifically used for Linux type of 				environment 
IBM Directory Server :Propritory product by IBM

		#System Utility Command 

date
uptime : It simply tells how long system up for ,how many user and 	load average .
hostname : it tells us about the hostname of the machine 
uname : it tells about Linux version 
which : 
cal :calender command 
bc :binary calculator   


			
			#Process and Jobs 

Application =service 
Script =Shell Scripts or Commands are list of Intrsuction 
	eg : adduser, cd pwd etc
Process  = when application is run process is started 
Daemon = Runs Continuously in background until interrupted 
Threads = Every process could have multiple thread associated with it 
Job = Run a service or process at a schedule time 

#Process or service command :-

Systemctl or service 
PS : what are the process running in the system
top : All process running on system depending on which process  u want to see first 
Kill : Kills the process by name or process ID
crontab : use to schedule services, process ,job .
at : like crontab ,at schedule only at one time basis

 
Systemctl command :-
System control command , used to start your application .
It is a tool to control system service 
It is available in version 7 and later ,it replacing  "Service" command.


PS Command :-
It stands for process status and it display all the currently running processes in the Linux System.
eg : 
ps =Shows the process of the current shell 

PID =the unique process ID
TTY = terminal type that the user logged in to 
TIME = amount of CPU in minutes and seconds that the process has been running 
CMD = name of the command 


--- ps -e : Shoes all running processes 
--- ps aux = shows all running process in  BSD format
--- ps -ef = Shows all the running process in full format listing 
--- ps -u username = Shows all the process by username 

top command :- 

It is used to show the Linux proceses and it provides a real time view of the running system.

This command shows the summary information of the system and the list of processs or thread which are currently managed by Linux kernel.
When top command is executed then it goes into interactive mode and you can exit out by hitting q 

When we run "top" command we get many coloumns as output :-

PID : Shows task's unique process id
USER :Username of owner of task 
PR :
NI:
VIRT: Total virtual memory used by the task
RES : Memory consumed by the process in RAM 
SHR : Represents  the amount of shared memory used by the task
S :This field show the process state in the single  letter form
%CPU :Represents the CPU usage 
%MEM : Shows the memory usage of task 
TIME +:CPU  Time ,the same as 'TIME' ,but reflecting more granularity through hundredths of a second.


Kill Command :- 

It is used to terminate the processes manually 
It sends a signal which ultimately terminates or kills a particular process or group of processes.

KILL [option][PID] 
	option : Signal name or signal number 
	PID= process ID
kill -l =to get a list of all signal names or signal number 
kill -1 =restart 
kill -2 =Interrupt from the keyboard just like Ctrl C 
kill -9 = Forcefully kill the process
kill -15 = Kill a process gracefully


		#Process signal in Linux :-


It means sending signal to running process.
Its purpose is to Enable Communiaction
			Manage Process

Types  :-
	Standard Signals :-
	
	Predefined Signals
	OS Send to process
 
	eg :-Stop ,pause and terminate
