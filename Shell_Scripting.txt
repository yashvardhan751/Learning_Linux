A shell script is an executable file containing multiple shell commands that are executed sequentially. The file can contain :-
1)Shell(#! /bin/bash)
2)Comments(# comments)
3)Commands(echo ,cp ,grep etc)
4)Statements(if, while, for etc)

Shell script should have executable permission(e.g. : -rwx r-x r-x)
Shell script has to be called from absolute path.
if called from current location then ./script.bash

Commands :-
	vi script1 
		#! /bin/bash - this defines that u r 			goanna run 	the script under bash 			shell.
	chmod a+x script1 :- use to give permission.
	./script - to see the output
	To run from absolute 				path :-/home/iafzal/myscripts/script1


   Example 2 :-

	-------------Defining tasks -------------
	
	vi script2
	
		#! /bin/bash
		# Define small commands 
		
		whoami
		echo
		pwd
		echo
		hostname
		echo
		ls -ltr
		echo

		In output we will be able to see the 			output when each of these command are run.
	chmod a+x script2
	./script2

  Example 3 :- Example of defining and printing variable 
	
	vi script3
 	
		#! /bin/bash
		#Example of defining variable 

		a=Imran
		b=Afzal
		c=Linux class 

		echo "my 1st name is $a"
		echo "my surname is $b"
		echo "My class is $c"
	chmod a+x script3
	./script3

#Input & Output 

Create script to take input from the user

#! /bin/bash
echo Hello, my name is yash
echo
echo what is your name?
read namecont
echo
echo Hello $namecont
	
	chmod a+x <script_name>
	./<script_name>


#If Then scripts :-

Example :
	#! /bin/bash
	count=100
	if [ $count -eq 100 ]
	then
	    echo count is 100
	else
	    echo count is not 100
	fi
	
Example 2 :
	#! /bin/bash
	if [ -e /home/iafzal/error.txt ]
		then
		echo "File exist"
		else
		echo "File does not exist "
	fi

#For Loops Scripts :-Keep running until specified number  
			of variable 

Example :-
	#! /bin/bash
	for i in eat run jump play
	do 
	echo See Imran $i 
	done

Output :-
	See Imran eat
	See Imran run
	See Imran jump
	See Imran play



#Do While Scripts :-The while statement continually executes a block of statements while a particular condition is true or met 

Syntax :-
	do
		command1
		command2 
		command3
	done

#Case Statement Scripts 

Example :-
	#!/bin/bash
	echo 
	echo "Please chose one of the options below"
	echo
	echo 'a =Display Date and Time'
	echo 'b=List file and directories'
	echo 'c=List users logged in'
	echo 'd=Check system uptime'
echo

case $choices in

a)date;;
b)ls;;
c)who;;
d)uptime;;
*)echo invalid choice -Bye

esac


#Aliases :-

Aliases is a very popular command that is used to cut down on lengthy and repetitive commands.

	alias ls ="ls -al"
	alias pl="pwd; ls"
	alias tell="whoami; hostname ;pwd;
	alias dir ="ls -l | grep ^d"
	alias lmar="ls -l |grep Mar"
	alias wpa= "chmod a+w"
	alias d="df -h |awk '{print \$6}' |cut -c1-4"




The history command in a Unix/Linux shell is used to display the list of previously executed commands in the current shell session. It's a very handy tool for recalling past commands, especially when working on complex tasks or debugging.


An alias is a shortcut for a command or a group of commands. You define it so that when you type a short word, the shell replaces it with the full command.

alias shortname='actual command'

alias ll='ls -l'
alias gs='git status'
alias update='sudo yum update -y'
