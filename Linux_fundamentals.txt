ls :list 
ls -l "<specific file>"

rm -f:delete without asking permission file 
rm -r :delete without asking permission in case of directory 

man <command> : IT gives u all options related to the particular command

# File permission :

Unix is multi user system, every file and directory in ur account can be protected from or  made accessible to other users by changing its access permissions.

There are  3 types of permission :-

r = read
w = write
x = execute(running a prgm)

Each permission can be controlled at three levels :-

u =user
g =group
o =other 

File or Directory permission can be displayed by running ls -l command

Command to change permission : chmod 

eg : chmod a-r <file_name> : it means deleting read permission for all files 

chmod g-w jerry : it means deleting permission to write from group in file jerry 

to give permission use command like + instead of - 
eg :- chmod g+w jerry

We need executable rights to Cd into the directory .

#Permission Using Numeric Mode :

permission to a file or directory can also be assigned numerically.

 -re -rw -r-- 
	-re : User
	-rw: Group 
	-r-- : Execute

Number 		Permission type 	Symbol 

0 		No permission		--
1		Execute			-x
2		Write			-w-
3		Execute + write 	-wx
4		Read			r--
5		Read + execute		r-x
6		Read + write 		rw-
7		Read + write + Execute  rwx


Do practise some practise assigning and changing wuestion

eg : chmod 111 sam - giving executable to everyone in sam 

File Ownership :-

There are 2 owners of a file or directory.
	User and group

Command to change file ownership:
	Chown and chgrp
	chown is used to change the ownership of file 
	chgrp is used to change ownership of a file 


eg :
 
chown root lisa - isse lisa file ka owner root ban jaiga
chgrp root lisa -isse lisa file ka grp ho jaiga root
 

ACl- Access Control List 

It provide an additional, more flexible permission mechanism for file systems. It is designed to assist with UNIX file permission. ACL allows you to give permission for any user or group to any disc resource.

Basically, ACL are used to make flexible permission mechanism in Linux.

Command to assign and remove ACL permissions are :
	SetFacl and getfacl

List of command :-

1)To add permission for users - 
	setfacl -m u:user:rwx /path/to/file
2)To add permission for a group -
	setfacl -m g:group:rw /path/to/file
3)To allow all files or directories to inherit ACL entries from the directory it is within -
	setfacl -dm "entry" /path.to/dir
4)To remove a specific entry -
	setfacl -x /u:user /path/to/file
5)To remove all entries -
	setfacl -b path/to/file(for all users)

Note :-

As you assign the ACL permission to a file/directory it adds +sign at the end of the permission 
Setting w permission with ACL does not allow to remove a file 
Help Command :-

There are 3 types of help commands 
	
whatis "command " :- it tell in short about the command
"command" --help :-IT gives a little longer description also give all available version related to the command 
man "command " :-IT gives a very descripted and formatted description about the command.

TAB Completion and UP arrow :-

Hitting TAB key completes the available commands, files or directories.
Hitting a up arrow key on keyboard returns the last command run 

			#Adding text to files :-

3 simple ways to add text to a file 
	vi
	Redirect command output > or >>
	echo > or >> (use >> else only using > will erase previous 	text)
	



		#Input and output redirects 

There are 3 redirects in Linux:-
1.Standard input(stdin) and it has file descriptor number as 0.
2.Standard output(stdout) and it has file descriptor number as 1.
3.Standard error(stderr) and it hads file descriptor number as 2

output(Stdout) : 1 

By default when running a command its output goes to the terminal.
The output of a command can be routed to a file using > symbol

Standard output to a file - tee

"tee" command is used to store and view the output of the any command.



			#Pipes
A pipe is used by shell to connect the output of one command directly to the input of another command.


		#Multiple command running 


In Linux we can run multiple command in one line provided they are separated by ; 

eg :

1)echo "hi" ; echo "hello"

output - 
hi 
hello

		#File Maintenance Commands 

cp :copy command to copy files and directory 
rm :
mv
mkdir
rmdir or rm -r 
chgrp
chown

		# File Display Command 

cat :list content of your file.
more :one page view at a time. 
less 
head 
tail

		#Filter/text processor commands 

cut :-
It is a command line utility that allows you to cut parts of lines from specified files or piped data and print the result to standard output. It can be used to cut parts of a line by delimiter, byte position and character.

	cut filename = Does not work 
	cut --version = check version 
	cut -c1 filename =list one character
	cut -c1,2,4= Pick and choose character 
	cut -c1-3 filename = List range of characters
	cut -c1-3,6-8 filename= List specific range of characters.
	cut -b1-3 filename = List by byte size
	cut -d : -f 6 /etc/passwd = List first 6th columns 	separated by :
	cut -d: -f 6-7 /etc/passwd = List first 6th and 7th 	column separated by :

awk :list by columns 
It is a utility /language designed for data extraction. Most of the time it is used to extract fields from a file or from an output .

awk --version =check version 
awk '{print $1}' file = print first_word of each line in a file
awk '{$NF}' = Last field of the output 
awk '/jerry/ {print}' file =search for a specified word
awk -F: '{Print $1}' /etc/passwd = Output only 1st field of 	/etc/passwd
echo " Hello Tom " | awk '{2 ="Adam"; print $0}'=Replace words field words 
cat file| awk '{$2="Imran"; peint $0}'
awk 'length($0) > 15 ' file  = Get lines that have more than 15 byte size 




grep and egrep : search by using keywords 
sort 
uniq 
wc
